# The Prism Chronicles

A Multi-Chapter Fantasy Text Adventure Made in Python

# The "Plot"

To TL: DR it, in the peaceful realm of Cubearot. There is a powerful relic that can control space and time called "The Warped Box." And their enemy realm, "Spherearot", has stolen the warped box! So the king sent their most seasoned knight to take back the relic before the king of Spherearot messes with it and destroys the universe!

# So? What's so special about it?

It's a multi-chapter (specifically 5 chapters). I made a Python 3.10 Text Adventure made in Visual Studio Code as my text editor. You will also be able to name your knight and make choices in this regard. Chapters will be added in future releases. No chapters have been created as of the creation of this README.md (August 11th, 2022 | 11:17 PM). In addition to that, there will be a discussion board, wiki, and project for this.
